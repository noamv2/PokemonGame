<h2>Project review </h2>
<p>
In this project, we are trying to "solve" a game that involves catching pokemon. The game is executed on a server running on our local machine.
The goal is to finish the game with the highest number of points possible, we can gain points from catching pokeomns. </p>
 
 <h3> The game </h3>
 
 <strong>Game map:</strong> 15 different levels, each has a map based on a directed weighted graph. 
 </br>

<strong> Pokemon's:</strong> randomly appear on the edges with varying values, each one has a 'type' attribute - with positive or negative value signify if the pokemon is on upward or downward edge.

<strong>Agents </strong>: the ones catching the pokemon's, each level has a different maximum number of agents, and we should dispatch them ourselves. Each has a speed that increases after they catch enough pokemon.

<h3> Restrictions</h3>
Beyond the obvious need to write a good and efficient algorithm, we cant access the server frequently, and have to keep the average number of calls - moves below 10 per second
 
 
 <h2>Design </h2>
 Our design conform to the staple OOP principles and to the MVC design pattern. <br>
